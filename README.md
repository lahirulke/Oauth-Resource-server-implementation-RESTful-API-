Oauth Resource server implementation
The Oracle API Gateway can be used as an Authorization Server and as a Resource Server. An Authorization Server issues tokens to client applications on behalf of a Resource Owner for use in authenticating subsequent API calls to the Resource Server. The Resource Server hosts the protected resources, and can accept or respond to protected resource requests using access tokens.

This is written using nodejs.
Run the program on terminal.
seperate json file ("oauth_data_collection.json") is given to generate POST and GET request automatically. You can import that
to postman or Advanced Rest Client.
